# Digiscape Provenance Ontology
An ontology for the representation of information resources within the [Digiscape](https://research.csiro.au/digiscape/) from a provenance point of view.

This ontology, which specialises the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s [PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) for the representation of provenance, provides a series of specialisations to describe major elements within the Digiscape project, such as *Source Datasets* (datasets acquired by Digiscape from outside sources), *Reporting Systems*  (listed systems that will report provenance in a standardised way - according to this ontology) and *Modelling Activities* (processes in which Digiscape models are run). The purpose of doing this is to ensure that fine-grained representations of provenance implemented within Digiscape adhere to an overall semantic model along for their interioperability.

As of February, 2018, this work is just beginning thus details are light! Please see the [ontology file](dsprov.ttl) for work done so far. Documentation, examples and live systems will appear over time.
